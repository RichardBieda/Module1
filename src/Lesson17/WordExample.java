            "    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\n" +

            "“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door\n" +
            "            Only this and nothing more.”\n" +
            "    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\n" +
            "And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\n" +
            "    Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow\n" +
            "    From my books surcease of sorrow sorrow for the lost Lenore\n" +
            "For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore\n" +
            "            Nameless here for evermore.\n" +
            "    And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\n" +
            "Thrilled me filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\n" +
            "    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n" +
            "    “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door\n" +
            "Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;\n" +
            "            This it is and nothing more.”\n" +
            "    Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n" +
            "“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\n" +
            "    But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\n" +
            "    And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\n" +
            "That I scarce was sure I heard you” here I opened wide the door;\n" +
            "            Darkness there and nothing more.\n" +
            "    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\n" +
            "Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\n" +
            "    But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\n" +
            "    And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\n" +
            "This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”\n" +
            "            Merely this and nothing more.\n" +
            "    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\n" +
            "Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n" +
            "    “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\n" +
            "      Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore\n" +
            "Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;\n" +
            "            ’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n" +
            "    Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\n" +
            "In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\n" +
            "    Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\n" +
            "    But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door\n" +
            "Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door\n" +
            "            Perched, and sat, and nothing more.\n" +
            "Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\n" +
            "By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n" +
            "“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\n" +
            "Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore\n" +
            "Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\n" +
            "            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n" +
            "    Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\n" +
            "Though its answer little meaning little relevancy bore;\n" +
            "    For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\n" +
            "    Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door\n" +
            "Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\n" +
            "            With such name as “Nevermore.”\n" +
            "    But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\n" +
            "That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\n" +
            "    Nothing farther then he uttered not a feather then he fluttered\n" +
            "    Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before\n" +
            "On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\n" +
            "            Then the bird said “Nevermore.”\n" +
            "    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n" +
            "“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\n" +
            "    Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\n" +
            "    Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore\n" +
            "Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\n" +
            "            Of ‘Never nevermore’.”\n" +
            "    But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\n" +
            "Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\n" +
            "    Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\n" +
            "    Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore\n" +
            "What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\n" +
            "            Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n" +
            "    This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\n" +
            "To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\n" +
            "    This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\n" +
            "    On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp light gloated o’er,\n" +
            "But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp light gloating o’er,\n" +
            "            She shall press, ah, nevermore!\n" +
            "    Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\n" +
            "Swung by Seraphim whose foot falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n" +
            "    “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee by these angels he hath sent thee\n" +
            "    Respite respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\n" +
            "Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\n" +
            "            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n" +
            "    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil! prophet still, if bird or devil!\n" +
            "Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\n" +
            "    Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted\n" +
            "    On this home by Horror haunted tell me truly, I implore\n" +
            "Is there is there balm in Gilead? tell me tell me, I implore!”\n" +
            "            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n" +
            "    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil! prophet still, if bird or devil!\n" +
            "By that Heaven that bends above us by that God we both adore\n" +
            "    Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\n" +
            "    It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore\n" +
            "Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\n" +
            "            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n" +
            "    “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting\n" +
            "“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\n" +
            "    Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\n" +
            "    Leave my loneliness unbroken! quit the bust above my door!\n" +
            "Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\n" +
            "            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n" +
            "    And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\n" +
            "On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\n" +
            "    And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\n" +
            "    And the lamp light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\n" +
            "And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\n" +
            "            Shall be lifted nevermore!";
